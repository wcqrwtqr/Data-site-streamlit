# Data-site-streamlit
Website containing several type of data from the oilfield.

The app is used to open three pages containing different data
1- Sales data 
2- Down hole memory gauges data
3- MPFM meter data

The application can be used to view the data in graphical way and slice the data into desired slices using a slider also for the MPFM data there is a possibility to get the summary of the data (average) printed for the user.

So far the data are fixed and I did not make the possibility to upload the user own data for online manipulation which will be in later stage

The application uses the following libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- plotly
- streamlit
